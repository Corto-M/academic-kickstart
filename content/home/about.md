I am currently a PhD student at LaBRI, Bordeaux, under the supervision of Anca Muscholl and Igor Walukiewicz. My PhD subjects involves problems of monitoring and control over automata-like models of distributed systems, but I am interested in all things related to verification, automata, logics and games.
